We should move the Chain IDs to a seperate folder
Maybe rename some of the files, ie like Make sure Capital letters and exporting correctly and such
I kinda want to put like comments in the modals and such to describe the relationships between files
ToDo definitely add back the classnames back into the SVGS, as well as establish default values
Look into Content Security Policy
Hmm that requires looking up the ESM conventions, 
and also knowhing what ESM conventions the current version of Next.JS uses
